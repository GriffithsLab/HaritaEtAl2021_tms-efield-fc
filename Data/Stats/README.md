# All about that Stats life!

This folder contains all the essential data that we used to carry out statistical analysis for out manuscript.

Each '.pkl' file is 12 x 8 table that contains the percentage of E-field vertices with maximum FC to each of the 8 canonical Yeo/Schaefer networks, for each of the 12 subjects.  

These percentage values can be derived by running the respective, corresponding jupyter notebooks found in the 'Scripts' folder. Additionally, you can find a graphical representation of these values (bar plots) in Panel B of Figures 2, 3 and 4 in the manuscript.


There are 6 '.pkl' files - 3 for dlPFC and 3 for OFC. These are broken down as follows:

1) ss_E_fields_const_FC - looks at TMS target connectivity using subject-specific E-fields and group-averaged rs-fMRI data.
2) ernie_E_fields_ss_FC - looks at TMS target connectivity using ernie (normative) E-fields and subject-specific rs-fMRI data.
3) ss_E_fields_ss_FC - looks at TMS target connectivity using subject-specific E-fields and subject-specific rs-fMRI data.
