### dlPFC (Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)

The subject-specific dlPFC E-fields can be found within this folder. 

### OFC (Orbitofrontal cortex)

In both the dlPFC and OFC, a threshold of 0.9 was used to limit the size of the E-field obtained. See the 'Methods' section of the manuscript for more details.
